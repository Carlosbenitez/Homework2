I made a responsive website that changes based on the size of the screen.

The website has three pages with a Navbar that connects them.

There are three custom css stylesheets that I used to bring some color and spacing to the page.

Bootstrap was use throughout the page to help with style and make the website responsive.

There was a reset stylesheet added to remove any preset changes from my website.

My contact page is not fully functional yet because I am not sure how to make a Submit button yet. Wait for improvements.
